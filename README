Purpose:

To test LinkedIn's functionality and behaviour by asserting commands and predicting the outcome of an
action. Uses Selenium, the Chrome Web Driver and Python to build objects.

User Interface (UI) Map is a mechanism that stores all the locators for a test suite in one place for easy modification
when identifiers or paths to UI elements change in the application under test (AUT).
